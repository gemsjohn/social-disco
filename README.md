# Business-Manager

## Description
As an aspiring entrepreneur, I want to build a social media startup company. In order to accomplish this I need an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data. MongoDB appears to be a popular choice for many social networks so I will give it a try! Ultimately, I want to build a web application that allows users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list.

Refer to the [Walkthrough Demonstration Video](https://github.com/gemsjohn/social-disco/blob/main/assets/social-disco-demo_01MAY2022.mp4) for this application. The demo will demonstrate the following:

<u>Launch</u>

- Ability to start the server and sync Mongoose models to the MongoDB database

<u>Users</u>

- Create new users via API POST
- Update a user via API PUT
- Review all users or a single user by ID via API GET
- Delete a user via API DELETE

<u>Thoughts</u>

- Create new thoughts via API POST
- Update a thought via API PUT
- Review all thoughts or a single thought by ID via API GET
- Delete a thought via API DELETE

## Installation
- `git clone git@github.com:gemsjohn/social-disco.git`
- Open the cloned folder in Visual Studio
- Right click sever.js and select Open in Integrated Terminal
- run `npm install`
- run `node server.js`

## Usage
